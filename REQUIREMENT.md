Develop a simple Personal Expense Tracker application. Users must be able to add and view expense records. Every expense must include: an amount, a date, a category (such as Food, Transport, or Entertainment), and a optional brief description. The application should provide a dashboard interface that displays the 10 most recent expenses and a summary of the totals broken down by category. 
This specification must functionally exclude user authentication and cloud storage features; the focus should be only on core data management capabilities.
Keep it simple, any other requirement can be added later
